Updates should follow the [Keep a CHANGELOG](https://keepachangelog.com/) principles.

## 0.0.1 - 2022-02-16

### Added
- Fills the login form in `local` environment.
- From `Laravel Voyager`, added the Database folder and smallest dependencies' footprint, to be used for now, for managing database schema.
- Ignore `public/dist` folder.
- `Admin/Database` controller, view, and start of listing tables.
  - Show view
  - Store action. Tests. Payload to create new table can be checked. We now need to make a form that submits a compatible payload,
    or something that maps to such thing.
